          This is a project Juile Powell made in She Codes Plus 2023. Book publishing is close to my heart and seemed to be the obvious fit with this project. I learned React with this project, a complex uundertaking, to say the least. React is like learning magic, its complex, powerful and mysterious to the layman. I am trying to become a React wizard.
